summary: "Are you wondering why your precious newborn seems to be wide awake during the night and snoozing through the day? You are not alone! This is a common pattern for many infants, and there are a few reasons why this happens.Newborns have not yet developed their internal sleep-wake cycle and have a small stomach capacity, so they require frequent feedings. This often results in your little one taking multiple naps throughout the day and being more active during the night. Additionally, babies spent nine months in the womb where they were constantly lulled to sleep by the movement of their mother's body. As a result, they may find the stillness of night-time unsettling, and they may feel more comfortable being active during these hours.Fortunately, there are some things that you can do to help regulate your baby's sleep-wake cycle. Start by keeping the lights dim and the noise level low during night-time feedings and diaper changes. This will help your baby differentiate between night and day. Also, try to be more active and engaging with your baby during the day, and keep the atmosphere calm and quiet at night. In conclusion, if your newborn is up all night and sleeping all day, there is no need to worry. This is a typical pattern, and it will pass. Just remember to be patient and consistent with your routines, and your little one will eventually settle into a regular sleep pattern."
